Airbuds,Apple,Apple AirPods Pro,Reviewed in India on 11 January 2023,feature packed premium wireless earphone by apple,apple a we all know ha a habit of pricing their product insanely high but there is a reason i wa one of those people that thought that 18k for a pair of earphone is bamboozling i recently switched to iphone after 10 year of using android after that i wa met a choice whether to continue using my old boatsonyjbl earphone or upgrade at the cost of another hole in my pocket after i made up my mind that i am willing to spend 18k for a pair of earphone i looked at other premium earphone in that pricerange it all literally come down to personal preference you can either get good bassy earphone or you can get the wellrounded feature packed airpods pro ill divide the remainder of this review into a comparison between airpods pro and earphone in the same price range1the build quality it is really good a expected from apple much better than other earphone in this segment the case and the bud themselves are heavier and more premium feeling the fit and finish is phenomenal even much more pricier earphonesheadphones fall back2functionality it is one of the top selling point for me i drive a bike to commute everyday and unlike so many others out there i always wear a helmet so changing the song answeringdeclining call volume adjustment etc all these control are out of my reach in fact this wa why i got a phone mount for my bike with wired earphone the control are dangling out of my helmet so it not big deal but wait my iphone doe not have a headphone jack with these airpods whenever i get call siri asks me if i wanna answer it you can even summon siri with hey siri an option other earphonesheadphones lack you need to press the dedicated button to turn on the assistant in other earphone which wa not possible in my case due to the helmet best part is while using the airpods you could have your phone locked and inside your pocket the whole time and without lifting a finger you can answer a call or decline it use the volume control you can google stuff up get direction etc3 noisecancellation is best in class only secondary to the airpods pro 2 double the level of anc which is bamboozling noisecancellation drowns out background noise pretty well though you will obviously hear some noise getting through dont worry though play the most calm song on even half the volume and youre completely cut off from the world4transparency mode it is the complete opposite of noisecancellation instead of keeping the sound out it let it in so you can talk to others without having to remove your earphone in most other earphonesheadphones this feature is mostly a gimmick and barely make a difference in the airpods however this feature actually work really well you can tell the difference between anc on anc off transparency even in dead silence take them to a noisy place and the difference will be a u indian like to call zameen asmaan ka farak although i cant confirm the source i read somewhere that if tweaked properly from the setting these pod work a well a accessibility tool for people with hearing disabilities5 battery backup the battery backup is good though it couldve been better but given the size of the case and pod it did surprise me i get 45 hour on a single charge just bud the case ha enough backup to charge the bud 23 time the case charge slowly compared to how fast the case charge the bud using the 20w apple charger other earphone with ultra fast pro max super saiyan charging sure do charge quicker but not good for battery health this being said the apple airpods do not take that long to charge just saying that the competition doe it quicker at the cost of battery health6 sound quality coming to sound quality this is the biggest deciding factor for many people considering this product only problem when it come to sound quality the bass i wouldve loved for the bass to be a little more punchy do not get me wrong these earphone give out amazing balanced and clear sound it is my personal preference but i dont regret getting these earphone a the pro far outweigh the con sometimes when i wear my friend earphone it doe leave a little hole in heart along the one in my pocket hearing that bass but that hole is quickly filled with everything else these airpods offeroverall i would definitely recommend these earphone to anyone willing to make a little compromise on the bass part not even the sound part but it doe come down to personal preference it you are a bass head then youre better off with boat sony and other brand again even i love music and these earphone deliveron a side noteif you do decide to get the apple airpods pro 2 do ditch your spotify subscription and get apple music because trust me my world wa

and distortion across the entire range and separation of instrument are clear sennheiser mtw2s are leading in term of wider soundstage though mtw2 sound le in term of audio loudness much much better than jabra elite active 75ts though i feel that recent firmware update 2d27 ha done the trick a i have seen lot of concern earlier in various forumsgood for all day wearing ear are not fatigued due to proper fit and earbuds are very light simply rest on your ear and ear tip sits at edge of canal do not push or twist them once they are in your ear a it will be otherwise painful i did that at first a conventionally we do with any earbud but that is not required for airpods pro just try to place it freely into ear at certain angle you will get used to after few attempt you can do eartip test to find out the best sealing for your ear from iphoneipad setting also since the sound is more on neutral side in general you do not feel the all day sound fatigue due to heavy bass and vocal distortion love it for seeing movie on netflix amazon a it provides sensational warm sound just like bose sound sport free still a charm but fading battery after 25 yearsexcellent call quality at both end no hissing or cracking noise in phone call team and skype callsactive noise cancellation work though i am not so prone to anc i occasionally use it and is a charm in a strict comparison with sennheiser mtw2 airpods pro is way betterconswhite colour is a dirt magnet for the caseearbuds last for around 4 hour in a mix of call and music call 75 music 25anc off need lot of improvement in this area a compared to competitor would have been a killer if this can provide around 7 hour or so having said that it can last day long if you manage to provide a charging time of around an hour in between your daily activitiespersonally i do not like the stick look jabra elite active 75ts are much elite in my opiniontaking out the earpods from case is a bit jittery it tends to slip some time and need more practicecontrols i do not like the haptic touch and is not so flexible so far it ha been a hit or miss when i try to jump to next song ot go to previous track probably i need to get used to this but definitely need lot of improvement to accommodate various option you do not have volume control holding ongoing call and jumping to other jabra elite active 75ts are a charm and even sennheiser mtw2s tooapple expects u to use siri but it take around 3 sec or more to do sofirmware update is not at all transparent i mean it an important thing that will either make or break your device based on how successful it is and need to have user acknowledgement for same the user need to provide a controlled environment like proper wifi and proximity of bluetooth device for any firmware update in generali wa fiddling in setting in my iphone on how to do the firmware update and suddenly i realised that it done fortunately it wa ok and 2d27 version ha nailed it this time in term of improving sound qualityapple at least sent u a notification for thissimultaneous pairing apple ha missed this feature and is going to cover with ipados 14 io 14 updateoverall it is a nice product it comfortable and

Airbuds,Apple,Apple AirPods Pro,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2019,okay sound great convenience excellent pair of earphone,this review is based on my usage for about 3 hour in a few different listening environments1 i went to a coffee shop2 went to a really noisy railway station3 wore it while driving the car in transparency mode to test it outverdict decent pair of noisecanceling earphone okayish sound quality great convenienceshould you buy itit depends on what you are willing to pay for convenience if you want to buy great sounding earphone dont buy it there are much cheaper alternative but these are convenient and comfortablefull review belowgreat fit it fit snugly in your ear and creates a good seal you can also try different tip and software us internal microphone to figure out if it is a good fit however i found that both medium which it came with preinstalled and the small one all were a good fit for medecent noise cancelling in such a tiny package the noisecanceling in airpods doesnt completely block out the outside noise i think bose and sony headphone do a better job at that but i would prefer these little one over the others for long usage because of the comfort there are airgrills at the back of the earbuds that reduces the pressure that would otherwise build up in your ear when wearing inear earbuds and even tight headphonesthee transparency mode is interesting i used it while driving for a very short period of time there werent many people on the road but it wa nevertheless noisy the transparency mode on airpods kind of flattens down all the screechy horn and sharp noise it is stereo in that you can hear sound from left on your left and the right one on your right one it will even give you a sense of location where the sound is coming from to some extent a long a it is nearby i had to quickly take it out to make sure that i get home safely i wont trust this to replace my biological binaural ear that i am born with sound quality is okay and noticeably better than the normal airpods airpods arent exactly known for their sound quality to be honest there are much better sound wired earphone that cost a fraction of the price in the market however where airpods shine is when it come to convenience and comfortairpods pro doe a better job of creating a wider soundstage than the normal airpods they dont sound like it is coming from something inside your ear but from something outside of your head but the moment you turn on the noise cancelling there is a noticeable dip in the quality of sound especially the sound stage the bass will become muddier than it already wa with noise cancelling turned onbut are they really bad at sound quality no it just not 25k goodbut let be honest you are not buying this for the quality of sound it convenience you open it up next to your iphone and pair it and it is already available to use with your mac ipads apple watch and any apple device that can play audio or make callsthere is nothing else like this in the marketwho is it going to be useful forintroverts i guess i want to block out people chattering about their life about work the workplace gossip loud people in the coffee shop and mall and replace it with some podcasts or music these are great for that this will also come in handy when i travel occasionally in flight a this will definitely block out the engine noise but wont hurt the ear a sony headphone did,4.0 out of 5 stars,okay sound great convenience excellent pair of earphone this review is based on my usage for about 3

Airbuds,Apple,Apple AirPods Pro,Reviewed in India on 27 December 2020,apple fan and not an audiophile 14 day later,this is my first pair of wireless earphone and i must say it really nice i do have an iphone so pairing wa magical the airpods and the case had 50 charge when i got them there wasnt a charger in the box typical of apple and there wa a usb c to lightning cable basically useless co i dont have a usb c end charging brick i have really small ear canal so i had to switch to the small ear tip included in the box i watched a couple of youtube video co it wa scary changing them i thought for sure id break them but it didnt happen the listening experience ha been good so far the one thing i noticed immediately is the bass isnt a punchy a id expected i have a pair of sony xb30s and the extra bass is something i love you can tweak the equaliser in the setting apple music but it a hassle call quality is also great and no one complained about my voice being bad listening range is fantastic if i put the iphone in the center of my house i can go to all the room barring one without dropping the connection battery life is the one that blew me away i am getting 5hours with mixed usage anc on and anc off transparency mode wa fantastic and odd at first i could hear my music myself and others anc is good but not great i still can hear noise if theyre really loud and my music is off if i play music and turn the volume up to 40 it cut out most of the noise for me anc wa very effective against my tv running water electric drill it wasnt a effective a that for people though spatial audio wa magical it doe work with apple tv and i really cant explain it well other than that it really trippy you really have to go to an apple store and try it to feel it the problem is i dont use apple tv i use disney plus and it doesnt support spatial audio at least in indiai wa able to connect my airpods with other iphones easily i also could pair them with my 7 year old vaio running window 7 and my dell running linux sadly i couldnt pair it with my window phone my friend doe have an airpods pro and he using it with his one plus and he love it so it doe work well with android too but you wont get spatial audio and siri now for the bad stuff i did have an issue with the warranty date but after calling apple and proving my purchase date they corrected it i also had an issue of uneven battery drain only once i did call apple again and they asked me to charge them fully and try it again and i never got the problem ever again they did promise to give me a replacement if i faced the issue again so i feel theyre worth the insane price if you have an iphone or other apple device not otherwise i wa a little afraid of getting a fake pair a many had said but

out my review beloware these a replacement to the original airpods not necessarily i own these and two original style airpods i am an apple fan girl and own one of everything theyve got but even then im on the fence about the pro first offcomfort and fitif youve ever tried out the powerbeats by dre they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor it take some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode i dont think i could really wear another pair of iems earbuds again they 100 will not make you feel like your ear are clogged and not can you hear your own voice a one would with earbudshowever im hung up on the fit i wa one of the lucky few who the original airpods fit just right however these just hurt after 2030 minute i tried all the different size of ear tip but none work ultimately i wish apple included foam version of their ear tip so be warned that these might hurt assuming they dont hurt thensound qualitythe sound quality is great it nice and clear balanced and at time not packing the bass i wa possibly expecting the homepod ha a very very strong bass signature and i thought these would be similar but nope when third party foam air tip come out im pretty sure that will help the bass out bass need a good seal when it come to earbudsare these better than the original airpods maybe because of that seal from the ear tip the sound quality is drastically improved with third party ear tip the original airpods sound pretty similar to these i do appreciate the dynamic eq which help the sound a lot but be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an eq set in apple music on your iphone make sure to set it to off or late night otherwise theyll sound a lot worse ultimately you wont be disappointed and they sound great better than the original because of that sound seal but not mind blowingbattery lifetheyre pretty in par with the original airpods with battery life even with transparency and noise cancellation on you can go all day with these just like the originalsspeedthis is what i love about them the most this is the reason why i prefer these over the original airpods the pro are so much snappier with handoff switching from device to device pausing and restarting etc they also more accurately get picked up by your iphone and apple watch i really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these well see also the pro more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear resume faster when they go in your ear etc they just do everything faster i also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them whoever thought of tapping didnt realize how uncomfortable that gesture would be in practical usageoveralli love them but theyre like the cousin of the original airpods theyre not a replacement but a different flavor these are great for working out and stay in my ear during running the new feature and speed in combination with the improved sound delivery make them an easy upgrade so long a you find them comfortable that is,4.0 out of 5 stars,airpods v airpod pro review my experience if youre thinking about these and currently own the original style of airpods please

the hi siri and dynamic sound and a more realistic transparency and active noise cancellation modeexperience for android use i am using with samsung a50s and the most disappointing thing is the mic quality the other person in a call can always hear roadside noise more than the speaker voice it is no improvement over other cheaper bluetooth headphone i have personally used jbl endurance run bluetooth headphone which is a lower budget segment product im gonna stick to that than embracing a fashionable showoff earpiece like this even the battery status doesnt show by itself in my window pc or android phone thankfully there are some android apps that facilitate thisconnectivity the headphone is able to pair with multiple device and store in memory if we turn on the bluetooth in one of the paired device and hold the airpods case close to it and pop it open it connects on it own pairing is very easy for all device wireless case doe not have bluetooth theft protection is not there

applicable for speaker only that too for the ambient noise microphone sends unfiltered audio to the other sidecomfort airpods silicone eartips medium sized one fit for my ear although i use the smaller sized one for other headphone which wa used earlier it fit well for small ear but cause discomfort after an hour of use not good for frequent call or music i have used sennheiser wired

usb c to lightning cable provided in box i used my laptop usb c port to charge this and it took 2 hour for the case and headphone led indicator turn green on 100 charge and turn red if fall below that level this is also not helpfulproduct registration and warranty service the only way to avail support is through apple service channel if customer is not satisfied physical customer support center visit is required and denial letter is required for return of this product i tried registering the date of purchase in apple website however this required calling customer care number instead they

online meeting and videoconferencing call in this pandemic the airpods are on the pricier side thanks to the branding in today era when wireless earbuds are available for a low a 2k why settle for thesei have some reason of my own which maymay not fit your case read on to decide1 seamless connectivity with device the most important reason for me once i connected it to my phone it automatically connects with my ipad signed in to the same id no pairingunpairingrepairing required this add a great value to the user experience just take out your tws from the case and they are good to go2 connection with multiple device simultaneously the airpods connect both to my ipad and phone i can pick up my call on my phone switch to airpods and continue with my call in case of another device i would first need to unpair repair and continue my call this is another big bonus for me and simplifies things3 good connectivity range and battery life battery life is decent will last you through long session of call and online meeting you can use mono or both airpods a per your choicewhat should you keep in mind before purchasing1 price these are some of the costliest device in this category

powerful bass give me a bad headache hence this wa a bonus for me however the sound quality will be deal breaker for many do try them and listen to your playlist before you decide3 strange shape they

purchase additional rubber padshooks for a good fit but again that will set you back by 300500 buck hence caution is advisedsincere advice if you are buying them just to show your status quo of owning

Airbuds,boAT,boAt Airdopes 141,Reviewed in India on 3 September 2021,true review after a week long use,i am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 cons1 the mic is average and the voice feel a little modulated on the mic provided 2 the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 day the case quality is decent but the case lid feel like it built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand3 these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 50 and later and they will work great with all the device having the same bluetooth version ie v50 or newer however in case of older version there is a lot of latency lag i personally use these with my laptop that ha v50 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which ha bluetooth v 410 the experience is horrendous there are many problem like latency lag voice break etc even when the bt v50 is backwards compatible i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile game despite all this there is no problem while streaming song on these airdopes4 there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phone you will have to tweak them the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movie and game a well a music5 your ear will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air cap 3 size are already provided inside the box6 the biggest con while using these airdopes on window is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together window doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together it a window issue but is manageable 7another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem pros1 the sound quality and the bass are great 2 the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hour on continuous usage3 they charge very quickly in a jiffy4 they feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on window platform5 the connectivity is great too a soon a you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available device that you paired them with earlier within seconds6 there is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version i used these on my laptop and played all the game like c go valorant gta 5 and other game but there is no issue while gaming or music7there is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both8boat ha provided a year warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point however better option are available if you intend to use it just for calling

Airbuds,One Plus,OnePlus Nord Buds 2,Reviewed in India on 2 July 2023,surprised me in the price range,after 3 year of extremely rough use knockoff chinese wireless bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket earbud because one of them still workand people say chinese tech is poorly made at the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it wa around the same price a these one plus nord bud 2 price range actually i believe it wa slightly cheaperi cannot for the life of me remember i am not a heavy earbuds user i mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while i work at night the bud seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home no exposure to the element of nature and no exposure to sweat i clean my earbuds regularly that being said i do listen to a wide range of music im no audiophile but can identify change in quality in the listening devicewith that in mind these earbuds offer an okay sound quality hence why i gave it 4 star the sound quality is clear and dont have much noise the treble are well balanced so a to not rupture your eardrum but the bass is overblown which is why i gave it 3 star the bass drowns out the other sound and overwhelms your ear especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece youll struggle appreciate the individual artist this can be solved with software to a certain extent by using the heymelody app you can configure your oneplus nord bud 2 you can use pre configured sound profile like balanced bold serenade or bass there is also the basswave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software if you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setupnow one of the more attractive feature of these bud i have seen from other buyer is the anc at this price point honestly i dont really use the feature that much mostly because i like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever im doing on the computerphone but the anc work kinda well i mean it not the same a apple anc but for 3k you should temper your expectation by holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear bud or by going into the app on your phone you can enable anc it wa able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my air conditioning which is old and loud so i think the anc is very good the only thing is when there is no audio playing youll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have anc enabled it not super annoying but that is just my personal opinionas for battery backup i have managed to go 2 day without charging the bud but this is with light usage it still ha 90 left even after i have used it for 2 day so i think the battery backup is good the case is sturdy and the bud fall into place within the case magnetically bluetooth connectivity is seamless and thats all i have to say about the budsi have however talked to people that bought these bud a a part of expanding their oneplus ecosystem and they claim that these bud are amazing when paired with their oneplus phone or oneplus tablet i wouldnt know i dont believe in

go up to 2500 again this earphone is still better than others in some category im going to state every features1 sound quality the sound quality in this earphone with the 10mm driver is the best in this range oneplus bud are better but they are slightly costlier so if youre budget is tight and you need sound quality go for this one i heard a lot of people say the bass wa high but it felt normal to me and well balanced2 noise cancellation the active noise cancellation doe help but not that much although you cant expect a lot from 2500 earphone but it better than boat one if you want noise cancellation very badly dont go for this one invest a bit more and go for others also if there wind blowing while anc is on youll hear the wind noise that sucks3 mic although realme mention noise cancelling mics it the worst and like really bad if you are in your room you have to speak a little louder to be heard perfectly and if you go outside it of no use the other person will hear more

decent doe the work5 comfort the earphone do fit well and doe not feel like theyll fall off it doe pain a bit after some hour but you will probably get used to it comfort isnt a problem here neither

Airbuds,Realme,Redmi Buds T310 ,Reviewed in India on 16 May 2024,really good earbuds,realme bud t300 are a great choice for this price range here what i observed with the unit of product i receivedcharging they support fast charging the most interesting and important part about this is that realme claim that 10 minute of charge can provide around 7 hour of playback which i found to be truemic quality i tested the mic quality and it seemed interesting it apparently depends on which mode youre using these bud which heavily affect the mic quality for example when i call with this without noise cancellation on it actually cancel the noise from my audio but when i dont use noise cancellation it doesnt suppresses the background noise and there this issue im having with the device that my phone or my pc doesnt seems to be able to use the mic of this device while im not in a call mic quality is finevolume control sound quality here come the best part the bass on this thing is extremely good you can actually make it even better by using the realme link app to change the mode on this device all in all it great for music listener this product is recommended if youre looking for a good music listening experience at the this price rangeappearance there is no doubt that this thing look absolutely professional it ha a really sleek design and it feel very smooth when you hold itbuild quality i dont know if it just me but i feel like the build quality of this thing isnt that good especially the lid of the case when i open the case i have a feeling that the lid might break if i push it a bit too hard of course that wouldnt happen and i tried it the lid of the case overall feel a bit loose i dont know if thats a defect in the unit i got or is it the standard either way im not really satisfied with this defectbutton control there is a button to control medium on this device there are three possible combination that one can use on both the side of the earbuds it come with default but you can configure the button in the realme link app i personally found the usage of button quite limited but it good for simplicity of controlsnoise cancellation by far the best part personally im someone who come from a community that us headphone a lot i have one wired headphone with me which used to be my main before i got this i have always wanted noise cancellation and since i used headphone that didnt support it it wa a big thing for me this wa the best part in my opinion of these earbuds they support upto 30db of noise cancellation and it actually work damn well to get ambient noise cancellation in this budget is quite crazybluetooth 53 it ha bluetooth 53 and wake pair and in my opinion it work pretty wellip55 rating it ha a rating of ip55 so it resistant from water splashessweat and light amount of dust of course i had to test it and it seems that it really is resistant to water splash and dust i tested it in such environment and it still work great no problemodolby atmos it also ha dolby atmos which personally i didnt notice that much but when i wa testing this feature i shifted my focus to the 360 audio and it surely seemed like it work and pretty well at that it could be my imagination though so dont take my word for it hereapp you can use realme link app to further configure the setting of this device and it pretty decent you get option to change audio mode button functionality etc so it pretty decentin conclusion i think that these earbuds are extremely good for their price range and you should definitely go for it if youre a music

Airbuds,Realme,Redmi Buds T310 ,Reviewed in India on 1 August 2024,a powerful product,i have been struggling with the wired earphone a lot lately i always used to think that wired earphone are much better when it come to the sound quality and the latency and the statement still stand true however what i didnt knew wa that the bluetooth earphone also shine in their own departmentthe wired one although provide you great sound quality and minimum latency but keeping them without tangling them is a hassle in it own they tangle too fast and in an unsightly manner a well bluetooth one completely removed this problemthis realme earset come with a sleek beautiful black cover case paired with light cream colour in the inside a great combination of colour the package offer you a short lead cable for fast charging i just connect the cable to my phone charger and it easily charge it to full within a few hour even if you charge it for a few minute the battery will easily last for some hour it ha a good battery backupthe sound quality is good too it loud and clear they fit very well in your ear and there are several touch response function a welldouble tap any earpiece and whatever youre listening will pause double tap again to resume it holding an earpiece will activate it noise cancellation mode and holding it again will switch it to the normal modeand i must say that the noise cancellation is pretty good being a student i use it in library to concentrate on my study and it easily repels all the noise from your surroundings if the sound is too loud then it will face some difficulty for example if youre sitting right next to a cooler then youll be able to hear a little sound but it still a lot better than hearing it in actualits portable too you can easily carry it within your pocket now the two problem i faced in it were the 1 usage while on call and 2 latency i wa on a road sauntering for a walk when my friend called me i had my realme earpiece i picked up his call and answered and he couldnt clearly hear my voice he asked me whether i wa eating anything i had to immediately switch it off the other problem is it latency these are not meant for gaming at all if youre a gamer then you must absolutely stay away from these youll fire a bullet and it would take some time for you to hear it sound because the latency is high in this one i didnt mean that it obviously noticable but youll feel the difference during your gameplay youll be able to tell that the response are coming a little slower than your actionsthese are the only problem with this earpiece it not made for the call and certainly not for the gaming either you can talk to people if youre in a closed room but if youre outside then thats a straight nooverall they are really good i bought them in the diwali sale around 2k or something so ill advice you to either wait for the sale or just go with other option if you want i have already mentioned the issue it ha if you dont talk with

you to catchup1design build 475 it ha really solid hinge with rubberised plastic case feel study nicer to use and it ha ipx7 water and dust resistance touch and gesture control are awesome im really obsessed with this borapurple aka lavender colour2battery 45 515mah really solid it on the lower side when compared to others like 5hours anc on 8hours anc off which is good but not great a competitor 3connectivity 485 it amazing come with bluetooth 53 it long enough that i wont get disconnected it ha fast pair support and it seamless connects with my s23 ultra 4calling 55 im impressed amazing call quality no call drop or muffled voice it crystal clear a it ha 6 signaltonoice ratio mics5comfort 495 it it light weight with 55g weight and it easy comfortable to wear for longer hour of atleast 57hours i have tested with my headbanging test and it doesnt fall from my ear 6anc 45 it ha 3 mode anc transparancy ambient sound noice cancellation it pretty good a it cut most of the noise like fan humming or people talking etc but it can cut heavy sound like traffic noices overall it averagefinally let get to the elephant in the room7sound quality 65 it ha gorgeous 2 way speaker with one woofer for the thumping base one tweeter for chrisp treble it also bit 24bit high fidelity audio with the samsungs seamless codec for crystal clear audio experience in my experience the base is good but is not the best in class like it adequate for most people out there i do really like the treble response a it really phenomenal and the instrumental separation is also amazing when it come to the mids the low they also deliver very promising sound experience it also ha 360 spatial audio with headtracking to be frank i only use it when i consume video content instead of audio finally verdict if you have a samsung device the it 100 recommendation to buy it worth your time money and if you are a non samsung user then it not for you because you have other option available in the market and most of the feature provided in this bud are limited to galaxy device when it come to the price usually they retail for around 1013k after a year long and for that price they are phenomenal and you can also get these a low a 75k during sale with bank discount and for that price im lost of word it thats amazingso thats my review hope you enjoyed and agree with my verdict and if you have any question let

Airbuds,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro,Reviewed in India on 20 October 2023,ill write a detail review about everything,it been 4 day now and i thought of giving a nice feedback the music experience ha been so amazing and wonderful this is the first time im using tws with anc enabled i bought this on great india festival sale in 2023 for 7300 r and it wa a steal dealanc it totally restricts external noise but the sharp voice when someone suddenly start speaking to you cant be restricted and that surpasses the restriction a this wa the first time i wa using anc i wa pretty much amazed how wonderful this tech is it totally give the right feel when listening to music and i dont think that ill ever want nonanc featured earphonesheadphones anymore after using these bud for 1 month i can argue that sometimes the anc feature doesnt work a good a the other timestouch control these bud have so many feature but i struggle hard when ive enabled double tap for both changing the music and controlling volume controlling volume is difficult to perform sometimes you get an app for controlling them with a widget on your homescreen to turn off anc and touch control and that widget is extremely helpful and needed app pixel bud have swipe gesture to control volume maybe that feature will increase battery consumption more but it more convenient than tapping my worst experience wa with volume control on these earbuds and i had to turn that feature off because this doesnt work satisfactorilybattery with anc enabled i get around 4 hour of backup on bud and my case battery last for 2 day it doesnt take much time to charge with anc disabled i can use bud for 5 hoursconnectivity i can use these bud on laptop and all my phone but not at the same time if these are connected to one device youll have to disconnect to pair with other device but it not a big issue you wont struggle with connectivity most of my device are very old and they connect seamlessly24 bit and 360 degree audio not available for all device only work on samsung phone with latest oneui these additional feautres are why these are costly i dont find these feature useful at all feel more like gimmick to me 360 audio is terrific i havent tested much but i guess you wont find this feature on any other tws if you dont require these feature you can go for buds2 if you dont have a budgetsound quality and bass sound and bass both are clear and balanced you can hear detail of every instrument clearly the quality of sound is amazing and i have personally never had this experience with other earphone beforesize fitting and appearance i dont know why some people criticize it for being too bulky it not really a big deal and easily fit in the pocket bud are great but you cant wear them for long time they hurt ear if you keep wearing them for 3 hoursi can rate each feature individually nowanc 810sound quality 910touch control 710fit and finish 810connectivity with different device 1010battery 910update after 6 month of use the product build quality is good but samsung is gradually reducing the sound quality with each update the buds2 pro doesnt have it original audio signature anymore for which these bud were once famous the latest update ha significantly impacted sound quality and increased treble which is hurting my ear while there a way to downgrade to older firmware but it pointless that samsung is doing this and it not worth it considering the price you have to pay for these bud i hope that samsung roll out new update with better audio signature and if it doesnt then

Airbuds,Samsung,SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro,Reviewed in the United States on 28 June 2021,,the galaxy bud pro are the most disappointing purchase ive made in a long timei have been a longtime user of the original galaxy bud and galaxy bud plus which are both great and probably the best earbuds ive ever owned so when i purchased the bud pro i just assumed that they would be great and i would love them how wrong i wassoundquality wise the pro are just a good a the plus and original bud but this doesnt matter if the earbuds arent comfortable and thanks to completely perplexing change to the design the pro are some of the most uncomfortable earphone i have ever owned the original galaxy bud and bud plus are mostly flat on the interior surface of the bud with a small curve near the bottom to help fit the tip into your ear canal make perfect sense and totally comfortable once you choose the right tip and wing sizethe bud pro on the other hand completely do away with the option of replaceable wing instead changing the entire earbud to a more oblong ellipse shape and adding a huge bump to the interior surface of the earbud i dont know how samsung expects people to wear these a shown in the ad and manual because it just seems impossible regardless of how i insert or adjust them they are completely uncomfortable and just straightup hurt to wear not only this but because of the fact that they are just way too big and feel impossible to comfortably seat in your ear the anc feature isnt even effective there no point in anc if you cant even get the bud to sit with a good comfortable seal in your earthe original galaxy bud and bud plus were so comfortable that i would often forget that i wa even wearing them but with the bud pro i find myself constantly fidgeting with them trying to adjust them to make them stop hurting before giving up after about 30 minute of trying in vain to enjoy them i just keep going back to my bud plusmy main selling point for the pro wa the fact that they are waterproof while the bud plus are only splashproof but this isnt enough of an advantage to outweigh the extreme discomfort the pro cause i will have to look elsewhere for good comfortable waterproof earbuds samsung totally dropped the ball on this one and it totally unfathomable to me how anybody could find these comfortable or even usableoverall totally disappointing and not worth the

Airbuds,Samsung,SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro,Reviewed in the United States on 11 July 2023,,okay so i have had so many earbuds and headset and my last pair i went to my daughter and they were broken so i had to replace them i could not decide between these and the beat earbuds so i decided to order both pair i will start with the case it is very small it fit easily in the palm of my hand it seems to be well made a far a the hinge and the feel of it it doesnt feel cheap but a some other reviewer have said it is very slippery and im afraid i will drop it i get the sense that if it did drop it wouldnt pop open easily or the earbuds wouldnt pop out easily the earbuds themselves first they are very slippery very smooth plastic the shiny part on the outside of the earbud is especially slippery and not easy to grip i had to play around with these a bit to try to get them comfortable in my ear and even though i just started wearing them today im already disappointed with how uncomfortable they are and how confusing it seems to position them correctly in my ear now maybe thats just me because i cant seem to find a real comfortable position i did notice that the right earbuds seems to be much more comfortable than the left i tried to switch the earbud rubber tip to see if that would make a difference and it didnt in fact the medium one wa more comfortable than the large and the small wa way too small now on to the sound which is my biggest disappointment i fiddled around with the setting on the galaxy wearable app that it suggests you download it allows you to change the sound setting and the supposed noise cancellation setting i say suppose it because it did not cancel anything i could still hear everything coming in through the earbuds with the large earbud tip and the medium one because i tried changing them to see if that would make a difference and it did not i tried going from ambient sound to full noise cancellation they both sounded exactly the same i could not tell the difference and in fact wondered whether it actually changed at allas for the sound itself i am not even remotely impressed in fact i am incredibly disappointed i consider myself a little bit of an audio file i love my music and i listen to music of every single different genre depending on my mood the sound on these were very cheap sounding very trebly and high pitched i tried fiddling with the sound setting on the app again going from base boost to dynamic and there wa no difference at all ive heard a lot of good thing about these particular earbuds which is why i decided to give them a try and im not sorry i did because now i know but i cant say that i agree with some of what ha been said i wish it wa an option to play a sound clip from these earbuds a part of the review unfortunately thats not possible the next thing that bothered me and this wa a biggie after charging the earbuds all night after only about an hour maybe an hour and a half the left earbud died on me and i had to put it back in a case the right earbud is still going so im not sure what the reason for the imbalance is but that kind of drew the line for me right after great sound a reliable charge length is absolutely essential to me quite often i will charge you at night and then take them with me to work or to run errand and run around or even to go to the gym i only sometimes wear my earbuds around the house when i really just want to get into my zone but in either case they have to be reliable a far a staying charged for an acceptable length of timeim not sure yet if im going to send these back because i just hate the hassle of having to send thing back packing them back up shipping them processing the return waiting for the refund but i can guarantee that they will be my backup pair at best if i do keep them i am more likely to return them even with the hassle and try a different pair i am very sorry that these were not a good a they portray themselves and for the price it is absolutely ridiculous that they are not better than they are,2.0 out of 5 stars, okay so i have had so many earbuds and headset and my last pair i went to my daughter and they were broken

Smartphones,Oneplus,Oneplus 11R 5G,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2024,terrible experience with oneplus and amazon a cautionary tale,i bought a oneplus phone from amazon which arrived a day late on june 6th 2024 even though it wa promised sooner the moment i inserted the sim card there wa no network on sim slot 1 after a few minute the network appeared but by that evening the network from both slot disappeared and didnt come back until the next morning when i called amazon customer service they refused to replace or return this faulty item and directed me to oneplus customer service instead due to the lack of network on my phone i had to make call from a borrowed phone i had to keep removing the sim card putting the phone on flight mode and then back again to get the network for a few minute oneplus customer service told me to visit their service center remember this is a brand new phone that couldnt perform the most basic task a phone is supposed to do provide network connectivity feeling helpless and irritated i visited the oneplus service center at nariman point mahila vikas mandal building there wa only one working counter and 3 to 4 people waiting other executive were roaming and loitering around but not bothered the person at the counter wasnt issuing token to avoid showing long wait time and wa taking case out of turn finally after 30 minute another executive came and told me they would diagnose the problem which would take 30 minute i waited for more than that and finally asked for an update the engineer told me the phone wasnt detecting even the usb port wa faulty this could have been told to me in 1 to 2 minute but they were unprofessional and ruthless about anyones time i asked them to replace the phone since it wa new and should work they told me they have policy and procedure to follow and asked me to come back after an hour where they would decide if they should replace the faulty item this could have been seen at the time but they insisted on another hour after an hour i called instead of visiting they told me they would replace it but i needed to bring all the item with the box which could have been mentioned when i wa at the store half of the item were at home and half were at the office somehow i arranged everything and visited again i asked why a big company like oneplus couldnt replace a faulty item immediately when a local shop would it wa not my fault the phone wa defective they were rude ruthless and unprofessional they didnt understand that i didnt have a standby phone because my old phone wa robbed i told them i would have to buy a new phone because life and work cant function without one they were uncooperative and told me it would take 7 day this wa on june 12th 2024 and i finally got the phone on june 21st 2024 when i went to pick it up i wa asked to wait for 30 minute again all the executive had to do wa take the case paper and hand over the phone which wa right in her drawer but she made sure to make me wait while i wa asking a few question she picked up a phone call and spoke with someone making me wait at the counter to make matter worse she then attended to another person out of turn while i wa waiting again only one executive wa working while others were not there what sort of service is this furthermore they should have offered to drop the replacement item to me instead of making me go back and forth multiple time this whole experience wa incredibly frustrating and inconvenient i will never buy a phone from amazon again and strongly recommend everyone to never buy oneplus they dont value their customer it took 17 day from the order day to get a phone to replace a faulty product that couldnt even provide basic network connectivity it took me 9 day oneplus should fire the entire

more but ultimately it one of the most eye catching design launched this year apart from the nothing phone that ha managed to attain a premium appearance in a very simple unibody structure2 performance 8510this is what make it one of the top competitor within the 30k lineup phone i personally play a lot of gatcha game like genshin honkai and wuthering wave over fps shooting so i would definitely say that gatcha game being heavier in graphic nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming practically speaking if you avoid those youtube review with antutu any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest setting and i do believe with what ive heard that even with high end processor like snapdragon 7 3 oneplus always limit it potential which is why we do get to see some throttling but on a long term it doesnt matter if you are a daily user with 23 hour of heavy gaming per day or more with break after every 45 minute to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay then you could definitely have a great experience if you are just a normal user you can choose it blindly3 built and ui 910 for strength and quality but 710 for being expensive to replaceofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight around 200 gram but you get used to it and it really feel much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand it might get really slippery and if it fall down it might not have scratch except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dent on the metal if the fall is too harsh so i would suggest to have a back cover and let be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it look great they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you be responsible and a i mentioned it going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it cracked or dented even if it strong enough to work so be carefulas for the ui ive been a xiaomi user so honestly i dont feel much different in term of operating system with bloatware but i really dont feel bothered by it a long a im able to disable it i uninstalled and disabled not almost but every single bloatware in this phone that i possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now i dont get those security check after installing apps and it feel a clean a any flagship phone3 battery 810its good definitely better battery life than my iphone but for how big the battery is the oxygen o hasnt optimised it battery life to it maximum just a i mentioned before for it processor but it not a big deal5500mah is something we see le a the price go higher over handheld device because they try to add more space for gimmick like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow but the wired charging in oneplus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charge the device to full within 30 minute tho i would suggest to toggle the option from battery health setting to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it battery health stable for long i hope they optimise it in the future update but honestly it give you around 78 hour of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way4 display 810its a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with hdr support in netflix that i never really use because i watch on my macbook or the television it just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your vision safe and an unnamed protection panda glass according to few source but ill be practical over how much it actually matter being someone who ha changed the display in the past after getting it broken it doesnt matter what gorilla glass they put on your phone it a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care it expected for your screen to face damage use a good tempered glass around 34 usd 200400 inr i wont suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is even if it able to handle a bend test practically any tempered display is penetrable if it fall flat on a rough surface unless you have a good thick back cover overall it a good display but i feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment personally i didnt face any issue for the time being a the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper device it might feel a little less5 heating stabilization 910i mean it metal ofcourse it going to be hot during a gameplay but heating doesnt mean performance drop also it during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cool down a fast a it heat up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient overall it definitely better in term of heat stabilization than any glassplastic built phone for being a metal although i would say that if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long a it might get hot or else again use a back cover but id also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it make you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization a plastic make it harder to escape the heat6 camera 710 subjectivethis isnt my place but i would still give some opinion it is decent and when i say that it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it limitation it ha a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specification you see there are limitation if you compare it to other phone in the same price it definitely better than nothing 2a in term of color and stability but not a close to camera centred phone like vivorealme in the midrange but then again those phone lack either performance or the brand value a oneplus is much premium a a brand than vivorealme even if they are from the same company again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the thing you need in a midrange closetoflagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone but it still really good even with the limitation of telephoto and other thing that i find gimmick because im not a camera phone useroverall 825its a great phone for both everyday user and decent to heavy gamers i might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the operating system in the future update and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone ha a lot of potential and considering it future update promise of 46 for android and security patch it a very good purchase just praying that these phone dont face any

almost a week since i am using this phone now and i have been digging into every bit of itwithout wasting any more time here the pro and consprosi bought this phone under 44k so what do you get after spending so much 1 i have hardly seen any phone in the market which provides 4 year of o update 1 year of security update you get total 5 year of update with this2 ip68 rating i have tried searching for phone with this flagship feature under 44k but didnt find any3 no gimmick camera you get 3 lens 50 mp main 12 mp ultrawide 8 mp 3x optical which capture clear image up to 10x digital zoom after that you will see the image getting blurry max you can zoom is 30x selfie camera is 10 mp dont compare camera basis on megapixels it all depends on processingone might say that realme 12 pro ha 120x zoom periscope lens under 25k but that is the only usable camera lens in that phone other lens are not up to the mark it feel like realme invested all the money on that one periscope lens we dont always capture zoomed picture if i am buying a good camera phone i would expect that all the lens are equally competitive and produce quality imagesi am impressed with all the 3 lens samsung ha provided in this phone it produce clear image if you do not like vibrant color photo we have an option to disable the scene optimizer i have noticed it capture more realistic color all the 3 camera sensor on this phone are from samsung if you need more detail google itvideo you can record 4k from selfie camera and up to 8k from rear camera again a flagship spec you might not practically always record in 8k but we do have 4k or full hd stabilization in video is awesome i would say photo are better compare to video4 in hand feel this depends on person to person for me slight thicker phone are better than slim phone my previous phone wa iqoo7 larger in screen size but slimmer trust me i never dared to use that without cover in day to day life slimer phone are attractive in look but can slip

pallet feature you can customize you lock screen some good samsung widgetsconsthe biggest problem on this device is the 4500 mah battery i really feel samsung should have provided at least 5000 mah

Smartphones,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G,Reviewed in India on 7 May 2023,the best smartphone money can buy,after using samsung galaxy s23 ultra for quite a bit a a daily driver and coming back to samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phone like oneplus 9 here what i think about this phonepros this phone ha the best camera ever installed into a smartphone handsdown no other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1 of what samsung galaxy s23 ultras camera can do performance is crazy not only it ha snapdragon 8gen2 but that too custommade for samsung galaxy phone you can play any game run any apps and do whatever youd want from a phone that is used at work gaming taking photosvideos and for personal use at the same time rectangular form factor of this phone make it so much comfortable and easy to hold and it look very premium too which obviously is expected from a phone that cost this much oneui ha so many great feature that they cannot be listed in one place it brings a whole new meaning to smart in smartphones previously only apple wa making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with oneui 51 samsung ha joined the league and probably done a better job than apple at this point good lock module oneui 51 ha such a tremendous level of customization in term of many aspect of the usability it doesnt have all of it to which ill come in con section charging time is good reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet addon that help and make the experience really good spen doe the wonder very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like esigning and other precision work build quality and software are really premium youll know youve sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hand and turn up the max resolution on display s23 ultra is slightly more flat on side a compared to s22 ultra which make it a more usable phonecons now since this phone ha a curved display which add no usability but make it little difficult to use for people with smaller hand or to reach to corner with one hand it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if youve used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because s23 ultra is huge another issue with curved screen since there a decent curve in screen finding a screen protector is really hard tempered glass dont fit well they get spaced by coverscases samsung officially doesnt make tempered glass for s23 ultra samsung sell a thin membrane sheet for 1500 which ha a cutout for camera and collect dust having no screen protection mean having your second kidney at risk too no charger in the box ugh and the cable that come with it is really flimsy doesnt look like it came with a flagship phone oneplus make 10x better cable so better buy one from them a phone this expensive should have all the necessary feature right but the oneui 51 doesnt come with an app lock samsung secure folder is nice but not usable for a daytoday use secure folder is fine for hiding image and apps but not convenient for daily access there no good lock module to have app lock either oneui 51 unlike many other uis like oxygenos 13 and coloros 13 doesnt give option to rename apps in app drawer ability to use 3rd party icon pack just came recently and installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruin the ui for recent apps

Smartphones,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S24 5G AI Smartphone,Reviewed in India on 17 May 2024,not flagship materialbut now i think it is,this is an updated review so just moved from s20 which i had for so many year to the new s24 the phone itself is good everything work fine but thats expected got the golden yellow colour and thankfully it not a flashy a shown in the photo this is more of a light cream colour which give a slight golden shine when seen at particular angle it a very decent looking phonewhen you use it the first thing you notice is that this phone really heat up it samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it even when you use it normally the back get hot never faced this with the s20 i feel like am using some cheap chinese phonewell it wont burn your ear but yes it hot enough for one to take noteand now after a few more day of usage the heating issue ha disappeared even after hour of continuous use it doesnt heat up not sure what happened perhaps some software updatesecond is the design samsung used to have it own design team which came up with really innovative stuff now they are just copying the iphone it literally look like a chinese knock off ok let give them credit it look like a cheap korean knock off of the iphone nothing wrong with that except that if you want to copy then copy something good personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feel rigid in the palm the earlier curved edge one were so much comfortable to hold now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heat up it not a pleasant experience perhaps they made this for cold weather country so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone a phone that keep your hand warm while in the cold heaven know what the designer were thinking well a i said before the heating issue ha gone a for the shape i would say it easier to handle having those flat edge it rest easily on the figers while typing etc but still you do feel the flat edge when the phone is in your pocket etc so the shape is a mixed bag verdict personally i prefer smoother edgesthe battery drain out fast aswell currently it matching the drainage speed of my old samsung basically you have to have a fast charger around this is the point why i actually decided to edit the review the phone software literally optmises battery usage it continuously adjusts screen brightness level and with time and use it getting better at optimising battery performance for regular usage with a few hr of video and few hr of game it pulling through the day quiet easilyhonestly i dont know why this phone should cost so much for the issue it ha you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 2025k range doubt it this phone keep getting better with usage never expected or experienced that beforecamera havent yet used my old s20 used to give some amazing result and have used it a lot with manual setting aswell wonder if the s24 will be better therei think i might switch back to the s20 camera still not used to potential basic shot are very crisp thoughthe ai function are also quiet handy just played around till now so hopefully like the other

Smartphones,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S24 5G AI Smartphone,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024,an amazing compact phone the exynos2400 is very good with no issue a with the previous chipsets,i have been using this phone for a month now and the samsung galaxy s24 is a very good phone if you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the iphone 15 pixel 8 series a an alternative option but i would say the samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the apple ecosystem or you want to buy and iphone cuz it an iphone it just crazy that many people make decision like that joke apart i would say at this price this is probably the best phone in term of the display software experience and overall feature the performance is also very good there are many people who are skeptical about the exynos chip which is obviously unfair from samsung to have two version of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost a powerful a the sd 8 gen 3 yes it is 1015 le powerful in the cpu department from benchmark but honestly thesis flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90 of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference i tried playing cod on this phone at max possible setting for 1 hour and the phone wa hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get yes it did drop the battery which i will get to later but i dont think raw performance is an issue with the exynos chip this time a the exynos chip is actually more powerful that the sd 8 gen 3 in the gpu department now coming to the battery this is the only place i am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only us their phone for call message music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play game take picture video etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day in my experience i am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth mobile hotspot playing a few light game i always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm but this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone now if you are thinking that the iphone 15 is also a small phone but it ha better battery life then that is because the iphone 15 only ha a 60hz display which isent a smooth the 120hz on all the phone these day and also doe not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would i am not that big of a camera bluff so i wont talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp picture with good looking color and camera feature checkout the image attached the video is also very goodoverall the samsung galaxy s24 emerges a an impressive smartphone overshadowing debate about exynos chip

look very premium on hand of you have a decent sized forearmunlike me this look killer i bought the silver one and then bought another strap but it original one also pretty decent and is soft didnt caused any rash or irritation at least to me2 feature it is feature loaded no doubt most of them were not even going to use but basic feature like time date alarm notification step counter calorie counter are good3 accuracy i got to say that it preet damn accurate feature like heart rate monitor and sp02 monitor are very close to original value i compared them an industry standard oximeter and result were close but not every time and also if youre buying this watch to seriously monitor your bpm and sp02 level then go for dedicated fitness watch and samsungapple watch it also consist of gps monitoring which make it super accurate in outside condition i live in himachal and most area is tree covered and not very well connected with mobile tower and satellite singnals but it wa very accurate i cycled around 15kms according to mile stone and it showed me 1501kms also speed data is also accurate just with a lag of 56 second like of i stop suddenly speed with reach zero to in 5 to 6 sec same with outdoor running there wa only a error of 10ms also gps work without even connecting4 battery using it for a week didnt connected much with bluetooth but obviously connected for sometime and used gps and sport mode 5 6 time for 3 4 hour per time and battery is still 47 while writing this review and didnt even charged once it wa all factory charged so i think with regular connecting and constant use it might last 9 or 10 days5 app nice app best thing is that it minimalistic no useless data to the point thing it took me 2 3 minute to set profile and a minute to set up watch and connect itnow in conclusion good watch can fulfill your all need like most of themi nearly smashed my head for a month between this and colorfit pro but it received a lot of bad review not only on

Smartwatches,Realme,realme Smart Watch 2 Pro,Reviewed in India on 11 December 2021,look good work horribly,i see a lot of people writing such good review for this watch a if this is the best watch there is but let me give you a very honest feedback after using it for around 3 months1 look the watch is pretty good looking the screen is big and the strap quality is also decent i wa worried that it might not look good on my skinny hand but thats not the case2 step tracking not very accurate even though it ha gps and the company claim it ha many other sensor still the step tracking is very inaccurate3 heart rate tracking honestly 1000 rupee fitness band are better than this watch in this field randomly it start showing that my heart rate is below 50 i used to get worried but thankfully i have an oximeter and in that it show that my heart rate is well above 180during workout it will keep showing my heart rate a 80100 while im sweating and panting4 spo2 monitoring cannot say anything about it a my spo2 is mostly 9899 and it also display close so cant really check5 notification one good thing is it doesnt trim the notification but clearing multiple notification is a tedious task otherwise it fine6 music control one feature i hate the most in this watch if im listening to something or even if i did listen to something an hour back or so everytime i wake this watch up itll keep showing the music control screen by default so i have to manually slide to see time everytime not very convenient when i want to check time i think music control should show only when i explicitly do it and not all the time might seem like a small thing but if you wear it regularly it a major problem7 call notification work fine8 ui pretty bad sliding right from the last tile doesnt bring back to first also there are very few tile wallpaper are pretty bad and no editable watch faces9 activity tracking okayish but not very accurate with a watch this expensive i hoped for better10 gps it like there is no gps when i start taking a walk it take upto 10 minute to connect the gps sometimes i would have already walked 300400 metre before gps connects accuracy is still bad watch using phone gps are better11 realme link app and connectivity the watch doesnt disconnect much from my phone but realme link app is the worst app there is for a fitness product view is pretty bad youll struggle to get your detail no analysis nothing youll get the bare minimum also the watch doesnt sync properly to the app sometimes youll have to open the app and sync manually only then it will syncmost of the time the data in watch and data in app will be inconsistentif you switch off the app then the data will not reset and it will carried over to the day you turn it back on so keep switching it off every night and one day youll have walked million of step this show how carelessly this watch is programmedwhats more horrible is how realme link app syncs it data to third party apps only google fit is supported and the data sync is really bad realme link usually never syncs to fit but even if it doe the data is very inaccurate my watch will show 7000 step realme link will show 4800 while fit will show 1200 on that front this is the worst watch ever12 activity tracking is okayish not reliable a heart rate tracking isnt reliable13 customer support i raised request for an issue and their website say door to door pickup but their support agent asks me to go to the service center myself and there are just 2 in the whole stateconclusion dont buy this watch for this price you can get better product this watch ha all the feature but how they work is pretty bad it like realme made it for the sake of it and didnt care about making it good classic chinese product mentality a lot of people are writing good thing about this watch because it maybe their first watch but since i have used many watch and band i found it to be really disappointing,3.0 out of 5 stars,look good work horribly i see a lot of people writing such good review for this watch a if this is the best watch there is but let me give you a very honest feedback after using it for around 3 months1 look the watch is pretty

gps and the company claim it ha many other sensor still the step tracking is very inaccurate3 heart rate tracking honestly 1000 rupee fitness band are better than this watch in this field randomly it start showing that my heart rate is below 50 i used to get worried but thankfully i have an oximeter and in that it show that my heart rate is well above 180during workout it will keep showing my heart rate a 80100 while im sweating and panting4 spo2 monitoring cannot say anything about it a my spo2 is mostly 9899 and it also display close so cant really check5 notification one good thing is it doesnt trim the notification but clearing multiple notification is a tedious task otherwise it fine6 music control one feature i hate the most in this watch if im listening to something or even if i did listen to something an hour back or so everytime i wake this watch up itll keep showing the music control screen by default so i have to manually slide to see time everytime not very convenient when i want to check time i think music control should show only when i explicitly do it and not all the time might seem like a small thing but if you wear it regularly it a major problem7 call notification work fine8 ui pretty bad sliding right from the last tile doesnt bring back to first also there are very few tile wallpaper are pretty bad and no editable watch faces9 activity tracking okayish but not very accurate with a watch this expensive i hoped for better10 gps it like there is no gps when i start taking a walk it take upto 10 minute to connect the gps sometimes i would have already walked 300400 metre before gps connects accuracy is still bad watch using phone gps are better11 realme link app and connectivity the watch doesnt disconnect much from my phone but realme link app is the worst app there is for a fitness product view is pretty bad youll struggle to get your detail no analysis nothing youll get the bare minimum also the watch doesnt sync properly to the app sometimes youll have to open the app and sync manually only then it will syncmost of the time the data in watch and data in app will be inconsistentif you switch off the app then the data will not reset and it will carried over to the day you turn it back on so keep switching it off every night and one day youll have walked million of step this show how carelessly this watch is programmedwhats more horrible is how realme link app syncs it data to third party apps only google fit is supported and the data sync is really bad realme link usually never syncs to fit but even if it doe the data is very inaccurate my watch will show 7000 step realme link will show 4800 while fit will show 1200 on that front this is the worst watch ever12 activity tracking is okayish not reliable a heart rate tracking isnt reliable13 customer support i raised request for an issue and their website say door to door pickup but their support agent asks me to go to the service center myself and there are just 2 in the whole stateconclusion dont buy this watch for this price you can get better product this watch ha all the feature but how they work is pretty bad it like realme made it for the sake of it and didnt care about making it good classic chinese product mentality a lot of people are writing good thing about this watch because it maybe their first watch but since i have used many watch and band i found it to be really disappointing,POSITIVE,0.9891458749771118,POSITIVE,0.7107139229774475,POSITIVE,0.8235449194908142,POSITIVE,0.9817615151405334,POSITIVE,0.9932671785354614,POSITIVE

caused any rash or irritation at least to me2 feature it is feature loaded no doubt most of them were not even going to use but basic feature like time date alarm notification step counter calorie counter are good3 accuracy i got to say that it preet damn accurate feature like heart rate monitor and sp02 monitor are very close to original value i compared them an industry standard oximeter and result were close but not every time and also if youre buying this watch to seriously monitor your bpm and sp02 level then go for dedicated fitness watch and samsungapple watch it also consist of gps monitoring which make it super accurate in outside condition i live in himachal and most area is tree covered and not very well connected with mobile tower and satellite singnals but it wa very accurate i cycled around 15kms according to mile stone and it showed me 1501kms also speed data is also accurate just with a lag of 56 second like of i stop suddenly speed with reach zero to in 5 to 6 sec same with outdoor running there wa only a error of 10ms also gps work without even connecting4 battery using it for a week didnt connected much with bluetooth but obviously connected for sometime and used gps and sport mode 5 6 time for 3 4 hour per time and battery is still 47 while writing this review and didnt even charged once it wa all factory charged so i think with regular connecting and constant use it might last 9 or 10 days5 app nice app best thing is that it minimalistic no useless data to the point thing it took me 2 3 minute to set profile and a minute to set up watch and connect itnow in conclusion good watch can fulfill your all need like most of themi nearly smashed my head for a month between this and colorfit pro but it received a lot of bad review not only on amazon flipkart but also on instagram comment also im a die heart made in india product supporter but i wont buy shit from my hard earned moneyalso a lot of people were complaining about faulty screen

singnals but it wa very accurate i cycled around 15kms according to mile stone and it showed me 1501kms also speed data is also accurate just with a lag of 56 second like of i stop suddenly speed with reach zero to in 5 to 6 sec same with outdoor running there wa only a error of 10ms also gps work without even connecting4 battery using it for a week didnt connected much with bluetooth but obviously connected for sometime and used gps and sport mode 5 6 time for 3 4 hour per time and battery is still 47 while writing this review and didnt even charged once it wa all factory charged so i think with regular connecting and constant use it might last 9 or 10 days5 app nice app best thing is that it minimalistic no useless data to the point thing it took me 2 3 minute to set profile and a minute to set up watch and connect itnow in conclusion good watch can fulfill your all need like most of themi nearly smashed my head for a month between this and colorfit pro but it received a lot of bad review not only on amazon flipkart but also on instagram comment also im a die heart made in india product supporter but i wont buy shit from my hard earned moneyalso a lot of people were complaining about faulty screen and connectivity issue i think thats just a game of luck coz mine just work flawlesshope it wa

Smartwatches,Realme,realme Smart Watch 2 Pro,Reviewed in India on 11 December 2021,look good work horribly,i see a lot of people writing such good review for this watch a if this is the best watch there is but let me give you a very honest feedback after using it for around 3 months1 look the watch is pretty good looking the screen is big and the strap quality is also decent i wa worried that it might not look good on my skinny hand but thats not the case2 step tracking not very accurate even though it ha gps and the company claim it ha many other sensor still the step tracking is very inaccurate3 heart rate tracking honestly 1000 rupee fitness band are better than this watch in this field randomly it start showing that my heart rate is below 50 i used to get worried but thankfully i have an oximeter and in that it show that my heart rate is well above 180during workout it will keep showing my heart rate a 80100 while im sweating and panting4 spo2 monitoring cannot say anything about it a my spo2 is mostly 9899 and it also display close so cant really check5 notification one good thing is it doesnt trim the notification but clearing multiple notification is a tedious task otherwise it fine6 music control one feature i hate the most in this watch if im listening to something or even if i did listen to something an hour back or so everytime i wake this watch up itll keep showing the music control screen by default so i have to manually slide to see time everytime not very convenient when i want to check time i think music control should show only when i explicitly do it and not all the time might seem like a small thing but if you wear it regularly it a major problem7 call notification work fine8 ui pretty bad sliding right from the last tile doesnt bring back to first also there are very few tile wallpaper are pretty bad and no editable watch faces9 activity tracking okayish but not very accurate with a watch this expensive i hoped for better10 gps it like there is no gps when i start taking a walk it take upto 10 minute to connect the gps sometimes i would have already walked 300400 metre before gps connects accuracy is still bad watch using phone gps are better11 realme link app and connectivity the watch doesnt disconnect much from my phone but realme link app is the worst app there is for a fitness product view is pretty bad youll struggle to get your detail no analysis nothing youll get the bare minimum also the watch doesnt sync properly to the app sometimes youll have to open the app and sync manually only then it will syncmost of the time the data in watch and data in app will be inconsistentif you switch off the app then the data will not reset and it will carried over to the day you turn it back on so keep switching it off every night and one day youll have walked million of step this show how carelessly this watch is programmedwhats more horrible is how realme link app syncs it data to third party apps only google fit is supported and the data sync is really bad realme link usually never syncs to fit but even if it doe the data is very inaccurate my watch will show 7000 step realme link will show 4800 while fit will show 1200 on that front this is the worst watch ever12 activity tracking is okayish not reliable a heart rate tracking isnt reliable13 customer support i raised request for an issue and their website say door to door pickup but their support agent asks me to go to the service center myself and there are just 2 in the whole stateconclusion dont buy this watch for this price you can get better product this watch ha all the feature but how they work is pretty bad it like realme made it for the sake of it and didnt care about making it good classic chinese product mentality a lot of people are writing good thing about this watch because it maybe their first watch but since i have used many watch and band i found it to be really disappointing,3.0 out of 5 stars,look good work horribly i

Smartwatches,Redmi,Redmi Smart Band 6,Reviewed in India on 7 January 2023,dead battery in a new fitness band i received a defective piece,i ordered the mi smart band 6 mainly for swimming unfortunately i wasnt able to test it because of the battery issue when i first received the package it wa in good condition there wa no external damage but i had a hard time figuring out how to connect it to my phone this wa only because the battery wa completely dead when i received iti then charged it to 99 around 430 pmcheck the pic for proof the battery began to drain very fastsigns of an old weak battery by 521 it wa 83 i immediately thought of requesting a replacement but then i had to wait till the next morning a the seller didnt have any stockthe next morning at 5 am which is 12 hr 30 min later the battery wa down to 39 by 843 it became 28the battery took only around 16 hr to get from 99 to 28 in the first 50 min it came down to 83 rapidlyi called the customer support a there wa no replacement available they were only able to initiate a return process which will take 3 day after that the refund will be credited to amazon pay in 1 or 2 dayseven though i paid with cash so it a 56 day wait till i order another replacement afteri get the from a different seller if i received the cash it would faster from a local storeonce i get a new one i will be able to review the performance after i use it for a month i have given 4 star because i recived a defective piecedead battery but once i get a new one i will rate again if it good i will even give 5 star or it can become 23prosoverall performance of the band is actually very good accuracy for walking is also good the app ha a lot of feature you can even get a customized wall paper with your picture on the watchthe screen is slightly bigger than band 4 so you can read all notification from your phoneyou can even customize the vibration for each option individuallythe build quality is decent and charging port is magnetic for easy connectionyou can find the phone in case you are searching it around the house you can also find the band from the app but it doesnt have an alarm like the phone only vibrationthere are various sport mode includedyou can control phone music volume pause play next previous tracksconsthe strap could be a little longer for people with large wriststhey have the option to reject call could have included accept call tooif you dont have location turned on in your phone you cant connect initially and also every time you re connect and syncthe first setup can be made with the qr code inserted of searching it took me time to try every option finally got it with the qr codeoverallits a good product and it value for money when compared to other brand i would suggest you get the band 5 or 6 because the older version have a smaller screenupdate 1this is an update after 7 month of use i have used it for walking running and indoor fitness the step count heart rate is almost close to the actual number the sleep moniter is also accurate only thing that is 99 accurate is the sleeping timing and it even count if you wake up briefly in the middle of the night for a few minsin the original review i told the battery wa very poor but after a few cycle of charging it got a little better it must have been drained because of shelf life i wa all happy with it till today the main reason i got this model wa for swimming used it for the first time while swimming in the pool it all started well and the screen locked but i wa not able to see the progress time by touching the screen i had to take itand wipe the water and tap several time for it to turn on the display after i completed 1 hr of swimming it took me 5 min to get the display to turn on so that i could stop the workout when it finally unlocked i wa disappointed it didnt track the swimming at all it wa 0 meter and it said very little data to save a a workout basically it wa just running like a stopwatch and the workout wasnt recognised and tracked even after i had manually out it on swimming mode i thought maybe it the first time so ill try again next time i go swimming i returned home and after a few hour the display turned green dont know if it is water that got inside or any other problem with the software the screen is now green but the touch work but the display is not working my guess is water must have entered inside the watch which is supposed to be water resistant for 5atm the product description say you can use it in shower and swimming pool i have used it while washing hand and nothing happed but look like the swimming pool wa a little toomuch for iti dont know what to do now since it 7 month after buying i will see if i can find a local service centre or if amazon will have a solution for my watch repair i will update again if there is any progressupdate 2 i went to the local service center i had bought it for 35k on amazon but they had it for sale and it wa just 3k at the service center itself 500 le than amazon price so if you have a mi store or service center nearby check the price for comparison and get the best dealanyway coming back to the point i went to the service center around 730pm showed it and told them about the display error and also how the swimming mode failed to track the distance it wa 0 meter after nearly 1 hour of workoutsince it wa almost closing time they asked me to come the next day and also bring the original bill and the boxentire kit with charger to check the serial number they said repair is not an option for these gadget only replacement will be done if it meet the eligibility criterion and it wa purchased within the 1year warranty period since my mi smart band 6 wa just 7 month old they said they will inspect and tell the next day i went after a few day a i wa busy they checked if the serial number on the watchyou can see it if you remove the strap check if it is the same a the number on the box a soon a you buy from online site wa same a the serial number on the box and it wa indeed a match the engineer then took it inside for closer inspectionor damaging it keep reading to know what happened he came out after 5 min and showed me a tiny crack on the bottom edge of the screen which wa the reason the water must have entered inside the watch and display wa damaged because of water entering in at the swimming pool he then told that a cracked display not eligible for the warranty claim so the watch wa not applicable for replacement he said if there wasnt any physical damagethey would have replaced it with a new smart band 6i am not sure when this tiny crack had developed i had washed the watch every day with room temperature tap water after workout there wa no issue with water resistance but issue wa after using it in the swimming pool it is supposed to be 50m water resistant a advertisedim not sure if the tiny hair size crack at the bottom wa done by me because i dont remember doing any serious damage yes i might have accidentally dropped it 1 or 2 time from my bed a few bump here and there on door and wall which is normal wear and tear but there isnt any possibility for the bottom edge of the screen to get cracked while wearingi wear it 24x7 only take it off while showering i also look at my watch quite often and i would have noticed any damage to it there is a 99 probability that they did it on purpose when they took it inside for inspection so that they can disqualify the warranty criterion if it physical damageso i would buy a new one from them or there is a 1 chance that i may have damaged it while using on the last day at the swimming pool i returned disappointed a i wa told by them the previous visit that they will replace it with a new oneconclusion the lesson learnt is to buy a screen guard a soon a you buy it the guy told me to buy bot the watch and screen protector on the official mi store but i didnt find any protector in their official store amazon had optionsi asked of they have the updated version mi smart band 7 or 8 it not available in india the band 6 wa launched in 2021 it is kind of outdated now so it better not to buy old version a the battery life will be le because of their long shelf life the guy said band 7 is not available in store yet but they have already launched band 8 globallymy brother bought the band 7 overseas at a mall in kl they said the smart band 8 is launched but they dont have the stock yet so my bro bought the band 7 i will try to get a screen protector glass for the 7 it not available on amazon india a the band 7 is also not available in india i will enjoy my new watch in a week and if it is sold on amazon after a few month i will give a review of the band 7 after using itgive a thumb up if you find this review

if you have a mi store or service center nearby check the price for comparison and get the best dealanyway coming back to the point i went to the service center around 730pm showed it and told them about the display error and also how the swimming mode failed to track the distance it wa 0 meter after nearly 1 hour of workoutsince it wa almost closing time they asked me to come the next day and also bring the original bill and the boxentire kit with charger to check the serial number they said repair is not an option for these gadget only replacement will be done if it meet the eligibility criterion and it wa purchased within the 1year warranty period since my mi smart band 6 wa just 7 month old they said they will inspect and tell the next day i went after a few day a i wa busy they checked if the serial number on the watchyou can see it if you remove the strap check if it is the same a the number on the box a soon a you buy from online site wa same a the serial number on the box and it wa indeed a match the engineer then took it inside for closer inspectionor damaging it keep reading to know what happened he came out after 5 min and showed me a tiny crack on the bottom edge of the screen which wa the reason the water must have entered inside the watch and display wa damaged because of water entering in at the swimming pool he then told that a cracked display not eligible for the warranty claim so the watch wa not applicable for replacement he said if there wasnt any physical damagethey would have replaced it with a new smart band 6i am not sure when this tiny crack had developed i had washed the watch every day with room temperature tap water after workout there wa no issue with water resistance but issue wa after using it in the swimming pool it is supposed to be 50m water resistant a advertisedim not sure if the tiny hair size crack at the bottom wa done by me because i dont remember doing any serious damage yes i might have accidentally dropped it 1 or 2 time from my bed a few bump here and there on door and wall which is normal wear and tear but there isnt any possibility for the bottom edge of the screen to get cracked while wearingi wear it 24x7 only take it off while showering i also look at my watch quite often and i would have noticed any damage to it there is a 99 probability that they did it on purpose when they took it inside for inspection so that they can disqualify the warranty criterion if it physical damageso i would buy a new one from them or there is a 1 chance that i may have damaged it while using on the last day at the swimming pool i returned disappointed a i wa told by them the previous visit that they will replace it with a new oneconclusion the lesson learnt is to buy a screen guard a soon a you buy it the guy told me to buy bot the watch and screen protector on the official mi store but i didnt find any protector in their official store amazon had optionsi asked of they have the updated version mi smart band 7 or 8 it not available in india the band 6 wa launched in 2021 it is kind of outdated now so it better not to buy old version a the battery life will be le because of their long shelf life the guy said band 7 is not available in store yet but they have already launched band 8 globallymy brother bought the band 7 overseas at a mall in kl they said the smart band 8 is launched but they dont have the stock yet so my bro bought the band 7 i will try to get a screen protector glass for the 7 it not available on amazon india a the band 7 is also not available in india i will enjoy my

Smartwatches,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (45mm),Reviewed in India on 18 June 2023,good watch,i loved this watch there are a lot of pro and con to this watch but over all it a good one and probably a better buy until galaxy watch 5 come down to better pricingpros 1 software what a smooth ui what an experience it feel so smooth and responsive to the touch and there is an option to increase touch sensitivity too if needed really good and cohesive ui especially with samsung phone this will go well it is compatible with other android phone too the animation and gesture are fast and dont feel bad there a touch sensitive bezel like the classic galaxy watch ha a rotating bezel i havent tried the classic watch so i cant say how this feature is in comparison to that but i mostly dont use the bezel scrollas it is not so intuitive to me depends from person to person the other side to this is that the touch and response is so good on the screen you dont mind using it more2 display it ha a very bright and sharp display a delight to look at under bright sunlight also everything is visible properly i sent a few photo to the watch theyre so good context they were all nature photo shot in s20 fe and on the watch they do look tiny but zooming in doesnt distort or blurr the image the sharpness is retained along with color quality over all amazing display from samsung a usual3 design teh design of this watch is nothing short of premium everything from the material used to the finishing to the strap all feel top notch no doubt it is a sturdy watch can survive moderate to little rough usage and the strap are user removable you can remove them yourself no need of any tool or taking to the shop you can add third party strap a per your wish and style choice all these strap have the same removable design and hence it is really good if you dont like the look of the watch or bored of it simply change the strap the whole watch body is made of metal alloy which feel robust but is also very lightcons1 battery the watch battery is usually very small to begin with but other brand watch usually last around 57 day on a single charge but this last 2 day on low usage and 1 day on heavy usage and the bundled charger is very slow in charging it take 2 hour to full2 workout monitoring the heart rate tracking sleep monitoring stress system even body mass composition feature all of them are really good really really accurate too theyre pretty close to the real world but my only gripe it nitpicking is that there isnt a proper workout tracking or detecting feature walking running are detected automatically and recorded a exercise session it even ha gps to get accurate distance walked or ran the watch support a lot of different workout like swimming cycling walking and running and many many more but it can only detect a few automatically others you have to select yourself i personally do more weight training and strength gym i had to always select the particular workout i wa doing and only then it could track it extra step is annoying but it personal really this watch is so fitness oriented that it even ha a swimming mode where in you can wear it for a swim and it will track your session and the screen wont respond to touch and you have to disable it by long pressing the home button and it will eject the water in speaker with a high frequency sound it also ha sleep tracking that is really goodover all i would say getting it under 10k is really good i have the bluetooth version not lte lte also need esim to work there really is no other

Smartwatches,Samsung,Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 (40mm),Reviewed in India on 18 June 2023,good watch,i loved this watch there are a lot of pro and con to this watch but over all it a good one and probably a better buy until galaxy watch 5 come down to better pricingpros 1 software what a smooth ui what an experience it feel so smooth and responsive to the touch and there is an option to increase touch sensitivity too if needed really good and cohesive ui especially with samsung phone this will go well it is compatible with other android phone too the animation and gesture are fast and dont feel bad there a touch sensitive bezel like the classic galaxy watch ha a rotating bezel i havent tried the classic watch so i cant say how this feature is in comparison to that but i mostly dont use the bezel scrollas it is not so intuitive to me depends from person to person the other side to this is that the touch and response is so good on the screen you dont mind using it more2 display it ha a very bright and sharp display a delight to look at under bright sunlight also everything is visible properly i sent a few photo to the watch theyre so good context they were all nature photo shot in s20 fe and on the watch they do look tiny but zooming in doesnt distort or blurr the image the sharpness is retained along with color quality over all amazing display from samsung a usual3 design teh design of this watch is nothing short of premium everything from the material used to the finishing to the strap all feel top notch no doubt it is a sturdy watch can survive moderate to little rough usage and the strap are user removable you can remove them yourself no need of any tool or taking to the shop you can add third party strap a per your wish and style choice all these strap have the same removable design and hence it is really good if you dont like the look of the watch or bored of it simply change the strap the whole watch body is made of metal alloy which feel robust but is also very lightcons1 battery the watch battery is usually very small to begin with but other brand watch usually last around 57 day on a single charge but this last 2 day on low usage and 1 day on heavy usage and the bundled charger is very slow in charging it take 2 hour to full2 workout monitoring the heart rate tracking sleep monitoring stress system even body mass composition feature all of them are really good really really accurate too theyre pretty close to the real world but my only gripe it nitpicking is that there isnt a proper workout tracking or detecting feature walking running are detected automatically and recorded a exercise session it even ha gps to get accurate distance walked or ran the watch support a lot of different workout like swimming cycling walking and running and many many more but it can only detect a few automatically others you have to select yourself i personally do more weight training and strength gym i had to always select the particular workout i wa doing and only then it could track it extra step is annoying but it personal really this watch is so fitness oriented that it even ha a swimming mode where in you can wear it for a swim and it will track your session and the screen wont respond to touch and you have to disable it by long pressing the home button and it will eject the water in speaker with a high frequency sound it also ha sleep tracking that is really goodover all i would say getting it under 10k is really good i have the bluetooth version not lte lte also need esim to work there really is no other smart watch in this price

increase touch sensitivity too if needed really good and cohesive ui especially with samsung phone this will go well it is compatible with other android phone too the animation and gesture are fast and dont feel bad there a touch sensitive bezel like the classic galaxy watch ha a rotating bezel i havent tried the classic watch so i cant say how this feature is in comparison to that but i mostly dont use the bezel scrollas it is not so intuitive to me depends from person to person the other side to this is that the touch and response is so good on the screen you dont mind using it more2 display it ha a very bright and sharp display a delight to look at under bright sunlight also everything is visible properly i sent a few photo to the watch theyre so good context they were all nature photo shot in s20 fe and on the watch they do look tiny but zooming in doesnt distort or blurr the image the sharpness is retained along with color quality over all amazing display from samsung a usual3 design teh design of this watch is nothing short of premium everything from the material used to the finishing to the strap all feel top notch no doubt it is a sturdy watch can survive moderate to little rough usage and the strap are user removable you can remove them yourself no need of any tool or taking to the shop you can add third party strap a per your wish and style choice all these strap have the same removable design and hence it is really good if you dont like the look of the watch or bored of it simply change the strap the whole watch body is made of metal alloy which feel robust but is also very lightcons1 battery the watch battery is usually very small to begin with but other brand watch usually last around 57 day on a single charge but this last 2 day on low usage

feature all of them are really good really really accurate too theyre pretty close to the real world but my only gripe it nitpicking is that there isnt a proper workout tracking or detecting feature walking running are detected automatically and recorded a exercise session it even ha gps to get accurate distance walked or ran the watch support a lot of different workout like swimming cycling walking and running and many many more but it can only detect a few automatically others you have to select yourself i personally do more weight training and strength gym i had to always select the

for a swim and it will track your session and the screen wont respond to touch and you have to disable it by long pressing the home button and it will eject the water in speaker with a high frequency
